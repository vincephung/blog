# blog back-end
Back-end view of the blog project.

## Description
This is a full stack blog built using the MERN stack that uses the REST API back end that I created.
There are three parts to this project, backend, admin frontend and user frontend. This is the backend. 
I used RESTFUL API concepts to build this backend api.
The core functionality is that users can create, read, update and delete posts/comments.


Here are the links to the other parts:

## Technologies used
* MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
* HTML, CSS(Bootstrap), JavaScript
* PassportJS and JWT tokens were used to authenticate users.
